# SQL-Google-Analytics-Data
a publicly available sample dataset in Google BigQuery
# Overview
This project analyzes Google Analytics data using SQL queries in Google BigQuery. It explores e-commerce performance metrics such as visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rates, revenue, and user behavior from the bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample dataset. The queries focus on data from 2017, providing insights into monthly trends, traffic sources, product performance, and conversion rates.

The bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017* dataset is about web and e-commerce analytics for a sample online store in 2017. It captures:

* Who: Anonymized users visiting the site.
* What: Their interactions (views, clicks, purchases) and purchases (products, revenue).
* When: Daily sessions throughout 2017.
* How: Traffic sources driving them to the site.
Itâ€™s a rich dataset for practicing SQL and deriving insights into online user behavior and sales performance
