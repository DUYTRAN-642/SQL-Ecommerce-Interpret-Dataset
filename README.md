a publicly available sample dataset in Google BigQuery

# üìå Overview

This project analyzes Google Analytics data using SQL queries in Google BigQuery. It explores e-commerce performance metrics such as visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rates, revenue, and user behavior from the bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample dataset. The queries focus on data from 2017, providing insights into monthly trends, traffic sources, product performance, and conversion rates.

# üìÇ Dataset Description & Data Structure

## üìå Data Source

The bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017* dataset is about web and e-commerce analytics for a sample online store in 2017. It captures:

* Who: Anonymized users visiting the site.
* What: Their interactions (views, clicks, purchases) and purchases (products, revenue).
* When: Daily sessions throughout 2017.
* How: Traffic sources driving them to the site.
It‚Äôs a rich dataset for practicing SQL and deriving insights into online user behavior and sales performance

* Size: the dataset for 2017 has more than 467K rows
* Format: .CSV

# ‚öíÔ∏è  Project Structure

There were 8 queries covered several points of view of this E-commerce website from general to details

* üëâüèª Query 01: calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)

    * The goal was to summarize website activity (visits, pageviews, transactions) by month for Q1 2017. This required aggregating data from a time-partitioned dataset and formatting the output.
      
```sql
  SELECT 
  distinct format_date('%Y%m',parse_date('%Y%m%d',date)) as month
  ,count(visitId) as vistis
  ,sum(totals.pageviews) as pageviews
  ,sum(totals.transactions) as transactions
 FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*` 
 where _table_suffix between '0101' and '0331'
 group by 1
 order by 1

=> Visits show session counts; growth may indicate rising traffic.

=> Pageviews reflect engagement; high ratios suggest sticky content.
   
=> Transactions track purchases; peaks might tie to January sales.
      
=> Data covers Q1 2017 only, filtered by table suffix.

* üëâüèª Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)

     * This query is executed to evaluate the effectiveness of different traffic sources driving visitors to the website in July 2017. By calculating the bounce rate (bounces divided by visits) for each source, it helps assess user engagement and traffic quality, focusing on the top 4 sources by visit volume.
       
```sql
SELECT  
  trafficSource.source as source
  ,sum(totals.visits) as total_visits
  ,sum(totals.bounces) as total_no_of_bounces
  ,round(100.00 * sum(totals.bounces) / sum(totals.visits),3) as bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*` 
group by 1
order by 2 desc
limit 4
```

* üëâüèª Query 3: Revenue by traffic source by week, by month in June 2017
```sql
SELECT  
  'Month' as time_type
  ,format_date('%Y%m', parse_date('%Y%m%d',date)) as time
  ,trafficSource.source as source
  ,round(sum(productRevenue) / 1000000,4) as revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*` 
,unnest (hits) as hits
,unnest(hits.product) as product
where productRevenue is not null
group by 3,2
union all
SELECT  
  'Week' as time_type
  ,format_date('%Y%W', parse_date('%Y%m%d',date)) as time
  ,trafficSource.source as source
  ,round(sum(productRevenue) / 1000000,4) as revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201706*` 
,unnest (hits) as hits
,unnest(hits.product) as product
